# Phase 1 Outline

## Daily Schedule for Phase 1

We are in session each day between 9:30 am - 5:30 pm, with a 1-hour break expected for lunch, either in class or in lab time. You are expected to be online and available during these hours.

Class meets twice a day Monday-Thursday, from 9:30 am to 11:30 am and again from 2:00 pm to 3:30 pm. In the interim, please take a lunch break and get started on the homework for that day.

Lab time continues after class from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm Monday-Thursday and 9:30 am - 5:30 pm on Friday. Friday afternoons are reserved as optional class meeting time, if indicated by your instructor.

Fridays also include mandatory group meetings for the Campus Huddle/Speaker Series and Career Services Modules. You will receive calendar invitations for these meetings, which are usually scheduled in the 9:30-11:30 am range.

## Office hours and one-on-one instruction

Your instructor and/or other members of the instructional team will be available during lab times.

You can reach out to us on Slack by using our name in the team channel (for instance, "@Amy Gori, when I run `git push origin main`, I get the following error...").

The instructional team are:

- Rebecca Conley
- Clinton Dreisback
- Mari Edwards
- Amy Gori
- Will Jukes

Instructors are also available to meet with you on Zoom during lab times, individually, in groups, or in the co-working Zoom.

## Phase 1 Topics

Topics for the first 4 weeks include, but are not limited to, the following. Your instructor may adjust this list as students progress through the assignments.

- Version control with Git and using GitHub
- HTML & CSS
- Responsive web design
- Programming basics and introduction to JavaScript
- Using JavaScript in the browser
- Forms on the web
- Debugging JavaScript
- JavaScript objects
- AJAX and using APIs
- HTTP requests and methods

## Daily Assignments

Monday-Wednesday, you'll be given an assignment that you'll work on during lab time that day. Although lab time officially ends at 5:30 pm, you will likely find that you need more time that evening to complete the assignment.

Daily assignments are due before the start of class the following morning. Homework submission is through GitHub.

Each day, class will begin with a review of homework from the day before.

## Weekend Assignments

On Thursdays, you'll be given an assignment that will ask you to bring together everything you've learned that week. This assignment is expected to be more challeging and take longer to complete than your daily assignments. You can expect to work on this through the weekend.

Weekend assignments are due on Monday morning before the start of class.
