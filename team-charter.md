# Team Five Agreement

### What would make this team and classroom a good space for learning for you?
**Babacar**: to be patient not everyone has the same speed of learning or digesting information.

**Jon**: 1. I like the level of detail of yesterday and the step-by-step building of concepts. 2. If someone has relevant and helpful info they’ve found, please share with the team through Slack or in class.

**Tom**: A good learning space for me will be a collaborative environment with an open flow of communication between instructors, guest speakers, and students.

**Kendall**: A group of classmates that are able to feed off each other

**Derek**: Knowing when to take notes and when to actually work on code as you’re showing us
(striking a balance between watching how-to and doing it -- everyone can say when they just need to try it themselves!)

**Kim**: A friendly supportive group where we all feel comfortable asking questions and being open to helping those who are just not getting something.

**Phil** : Class and Material well organized and presented in a complete and logical manner.
(Freedom to interrupt when you feel lost or aren’t following the thread of what someone is saying)

**David**: In my own personal experience, I always learned best when I reviewed the material we learned in class and tried to attempt it myself and try to get feedback from fellow classmates or the instructor. I believe when it comes to helping someone with a line of code or certain topic, the best way to help them learn is to guide them and not just outright tell them the answer.

**Charlette**: For this to be a good place for learning, I need to be taught the basics in a clear way like I am in kindergarten.

**Nathan**: Helpful and timely feedback with regards to in-class questions and questions about assignments. People willing to help each other out, and willing to ask questions. Clear communication from the instructor about what is expected from students.

### What would make this a safe and respectful place to work in?

**Bababcar**: be helpful and don’t be judgemental

**Kendall**: Everybody knowing that we are all coming in with different experience prior to this course, so we should help others who may seem behind.

**Derek**: I get comfortable with time, in a few days it will all feel normal to interact more and ask questions easier

**David**: Obviously avoid certain topics that are not relevant to class material like religion, politics etc. Always try not to talk over one another and respect everyone's learning pace.

**Kim**: Never putting anyone down for asking questions (including yourself!).

**Tom**: A safe and respectful working space will be one where each of us has the understanding that everyone will learn at a different pace and that the learning process for each individual is important to us separately as it can inform the way we understand the material ourselves. Sometimes we may be the first person to understand something and sometimes we’ll be the last, but we should always be patient and learn from each other.

**Phil**: No politics or religion references. Keep things professional and respectful.

**Charlette**: This would be a safe and respectful place to work as long as no one makes fun of my need to be treated like I am in kindergarten!!!

**Jon**: Encourage everyone to work with different folks on the team, so we can learn more from everyone. If you can help someone, help them...don’t wait for someone else to help.

**Nathan**: Avoiding judgement with regards to questions and answers.
