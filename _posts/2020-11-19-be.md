Today, we are going to talk about:

- creating models with relationships via API
- using viewsets and routers
- making custom permission classes

For this weekend, you need to finish up your API for HabitTracker. Specifically,

- all habits can be read via the API
- habits and records can be created via the API
- proper permissions are on habits and records
  - habits can be edited and deleted by their author
  - records can be edited and deleted by their author
