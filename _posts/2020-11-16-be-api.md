Today we're learning about HTTP requests and responses, REST, and the Django REST Framework.

## Assignment

[Complete the official Django REST Framework tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/).

**DO NOT** follow their directions for "Setting Up a New Environment." Instead create a new directory and inside that directory, run:

```
pipenv --three
pipenv shell
pipenv install django
pipenv install djangorestframework
pipenv install pygments
django-admin startproject tutorial
cd tutorial
```

You can pick things up starting with the line "Once that's done we can create an app that we'll use to create a simple Web API."
