### ‚≠êÔ∏è EXTRA/TMI

There's a an awesome article about _stacks_, which we encounter in a _stack trace_ in our debugging adventures, in Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series. It's not necessary to read this to understand debugging, but if you want some more information about terminology and what's really happening, it's great!
