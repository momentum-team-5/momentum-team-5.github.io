### Post-video note
By the end of class we had gotten as far as getting a 403 request from our Django application.
The solution is to add the following to our AJAX request:

    headers: { "x-csrftoken": form.elements["csrfmiddlewaretoken"].value },

This ensures that the token generated by `{% csrf_token %}` is included in the request (when you
submit a form normally django knows how to handle it, but when you send an AJAX request this
needs to be specified).
