Today, we are going to look at how to use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to make front-end applications that have multiple URLs and use _client-side routing_ to make it easy to navigate between them.

We will also look at how to deploy our React applications to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
