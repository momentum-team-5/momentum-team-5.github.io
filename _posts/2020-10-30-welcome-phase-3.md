Welcome, all, to Phase 3! We are about to have a very exciting five weeks together.

We're going to take the first week to strengthen our knowledge of Django with a set of lessons I call "Django from the Ground Up." Now that you've gotten familiar enough with it to see it work together, we'll break down how to use each piece effectively.

After that, you'll move into your front-end and back-end classes.

## Schedule

**Week 1 (Nov 2-6)**

- Lecture M, W, Th from 9:30-11:30 AM
- Small groups M, W, Th from 1-3 PM
- Check-in with Clinton, M, W, Th from 3:30-4 PM
- Tuesday: go vote, study hard

**Weeks 2-5**

In Phase 3 proper, we meet three days a week (M, Tu, Th). Front-end meets from 9:30-11:30 AM and back-end meets 2-4 PM. You will schedule two one-on-ones with me as well: Wednesday is reserved for those.
