### Exercism: JavaScript Track

To get some more practice writing JavaScript, we're going to use an awesome free online tool called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Please sign up (you can use your GitHub account) and choose [the JavaScript track](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript). There are two ways to use Exercism, in Practice Mode or Mentor Mode. For now, just choose Practice Mode.

Work through the setup instructions to install Exercism on your computer with Homebrew. Complete _at minimum the first three_ following exercises in the JavaScript track:

1. **Hello World**
2. **TwoFer**
3. **Raindrops**
4. **Hamming**
5. **High Scores**
6. **Word Count**

For each exercise, follow the instructions on Exercism to upload your solution.

**To submit your homework, paste your solution urls into [this form](https://forms.gle/F3dnTMT45btZeDGQ9).**
